# Chapter 3 - Functions and Packages

> You'll learn how to use functions, methods, and packages to efficiently leverage the code that brilliant Python developers have written. The goal is to reduce the amount of code you need to solve challenging problems!

---

### 3-1 Familiar functions

---

#### Exercise

Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: `print()` and `type()`. You've also used the functions `str()`, `int()`, `bool()` and `float() `to switch between data types. These are built-in functions as well.

Calling a function is easy. To get the type of `3.0` and store the output as a new variable, `result`, you can use the following:

```python
result = type(3.0)
```

The general recipe for calling functions and saving the result to a variable is thus:

```python
output = function_name(input)
```

#### Instructions

- Use `print()` in combination with `type()` to print out the type of `var1`.
- Use `len()` to get the length of the list `var1`. Wrap it in a ``print()` call to directly print it out.
- Use `int()` to convert `var2` to an integer. Store the output as `out2`.

```python
# Create variables var1 and var2
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var2 = True

# Print out type of var1
print(type(var1))

# Print out length of var1
print(len(var1))

# Convert var2 to an integer: out2
out2 = int(var2)

```

### 3-2 Help!

---

#### Exercise

Maybe you already know the name of a Python function, but you still have to figure out how to use it. Ironically, you have to ask for information about a function with another function: `help()`. In IPython specifically, you can also use `?` before the function name.

To get help on the `max()` function, for example, you can use one of these calls:

```python
help(max)
?max
```

Use the Shell to open up the documentation on `complex()`. Which of the following statements is true?

#### Instructions

Possible Answers

- ðŸ”² complex() takes exactly two arguments: real and [, imag].
- ðŸ”² complex() takes two arguments: real and imag. Both these arguments are required.
- âœ… complex() takes two arguments: real and imag. real is a required argument, imag is an optional argument.
- ðŸ”² complex() takes two arguments: real and imag. If you don't specify imag, it is set to 1 by Python.

---

### 3-3 Multiple arguments

---

#### Exercise

In the previous exercise, the square brackets around im`ag in the documentation showed us that the `imag`` argument is optional. But Python also uses a different way to tell users about arguments being optional.

Have a look at the documentation of `sorted()` by typing `help(sorted)` in the IPython Shell.

You'll see that `sorted()` takes three arguments: `iterable`, `key` and `reverse`.

key=None means that if you don't specify the `key` argument, it will be `None`. `reverse=False` means that if you don't specify the `reverse` argument, it will be `False`.

In this exercise, you'll only have to specify `iterable` and `reverse`, not `key`. The first input you pass to `sorted()` will be matched to the `iterable` argument, but what about the second input? To tell Python you want to specify `reverse` without changing anything about `key`, you can use `=`:

```python
sorted(___, reverse = ___)
```

Two lists have been created for you in the editor. Can you paste them together and sort them in descending order?

Note: For now, we can understand an [iterable](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-iterable) as being any collection of objects, e.g. a List.

#### Instructions

- Use `+` to merge the contents of `first` and `second` into a new list: `full`.
- Call `sorted()` on `full` and specify the `reverse` argument to be `True`. Save the sorted list as `full_sorted`.
- Finish off by printing out `full_sorted`.

```python
# Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Paste together first and second: full
full = first + second

# Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted = sorted(full, reverse=True)

# Print out full_sorted
print(full_sorted)

```

### 3-4 String Methods

---

#### Exercise

Strings come with a bunch of methods. Follow the instructions closely to discover some of them. If you want to discover them in more detail, you can always type `help(str) `in the IPython Shell.

A string `place` has already been created for you to experiment with.

#### Instructions

- Use the `upper()` method on `place` and store the result in `place_up`. Use the syntax for calling methods that you learned in the previous video.
- Print out `place` and `place_up`. Did both change?
- Print out the number of o's on the variable `place` by calling `count()` on `place` and passing the letter `'o'` as an input to the method. We're talking about the variable `place`, not the word `"place"`!

```python
# string to experiment with: place
place = "poolhouse"

# Use upper() on place: place_up
place_up = place.upper()

# Print out place and place_up
print(place)
print(place_up)

# Print out the number of o's in place
print(place.count('o'))

```

---

### 3-5 List Methods

---

#### Exercise

Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods. In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:

- `index()`, to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and
- `count()`, to get the number of times an element appears in a list.

You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: `areas`.

#### Instructions

- Use the `index()` method to get the index of the element in areas that is equal to `20.0`. Print out this index.
- Call `count()` on `areas` to find out how many times `9.50` appears in the list. Again, simply print out this number.

```python
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))

# Print out how often 9.50 appears in areas
print(areas.count(9.50))
```

---

### 3-6 List Methods (2)

---

#### Exercise

Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods. In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:

- `append()`, that adds an element to the list it is called on,
- `remove()`, that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and
- `reverse()`, that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.

You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: `areas`.

#### Instructions

- Use `append()` twice to add the size of the poolhouse and the garage again: `24.5` and `15.45`, respectively. Make sure to add them in this order.
- Print out `areas`
- Use the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of the elements in `areas`.
- Print out `areas` once more.

```python
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size
areas.append(24.5)
areas.append(15.45)

# Print out areas
print(areas)

# Reverse the orders of the elements in areas
areas.reverse()

# Print out areas
print(areas)
```

### 3-7 Import package

---

#### Exercise

As a data scientist, some notions of geometry never hurt. Let's refresh some of the basics.

For a fancy clustering algorithm, you want to find the circumference, C, and area, A, of a circle. When the radius of the circle is `r`, you can calculate C and A as:

```
C = 2â„¼r
A = â„¼r**2
```

To use the constant `pi`, you'll need the `math` package. A variable r is already coded in the script. Fill in the code to calculate `C` and `A` and see how the `print()` functions create some nice printouts.

#### Instructions

- Import the `math` package. Now you can access the constant `pi` with `math.pi`.
- Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in `C`.
- Calculate the area of the circle and store it in `A`.

```python
# Definition of radius
r = 0.43

# Import the math package
import math

# Calculate C
C = 2 * math.pi * r

# Calculate A
A = math.pi * r ** 2

# Build printout
print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))
```

### 3-8 Selective import

---

#### Exercise

General imports, like `import math`, make all functionality from the `math` package available to you. However, if you decide to only use a specific part of a package, you can always make your import more selective:

```python
from math import pi
```

Let's say the Moon's orbit around planet Earth is a perfect circle, with a radius `r` (in km) that is defined in the script.

#### Instructions

- Perform a selective import from the `math` package where you only import the `radians` function.
- Calculate the distance travelled by the Moon over 12 degrees of its orbit. Assign the result to `dist`. You can calculate this as `r * phi`, where `r` is the radius and phi is the angle in radians. To convert an angle in degrees to an angle in radians, use the `radians()` function, which you just imported.
- Print out `dist`.

```python
# Definition of radius
r = 192500

# Import radians function of math package
from math import radians

# Travel distance of Moon over 12 degrees. Store in dist.
dist = r * radians(12)

# Print out dist
print(dist)
```

### 3-9 Different ways of importing

---

#### Exercise

There are several ways to import packages and modules into Python. Depending on the import call, you'll have to use different Python code.

Suppose you want to use the function `inv()`, which is in the `linalg` subpackage of the `scipy` package. You want to be able to use this function as follows:

```python
my_inv([[1,2], [3,4]])
```

Which `import` statement will you need in order to run the above code without an error?

#### Instructions

Possible Answers

- ðŸ”² import scipy
- ðŸ”² import scipy.linalg
- ðŸ”² from scipy.linalg import my_inv
- âœ… from scipy.linalg import inv as my_inv
